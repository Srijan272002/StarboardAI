# CORS Issue Fix Status

## Problem Identified
The error "Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/properties/' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy" indicates a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issue between the frontend and backend.

## Root Cause
1. The backend CORS configuration was not correctly set up to allow requests from the frontend origin
2. The CORS origins list was using a wildcard `["*"]` which doesn't work with credentials
3. The frontend fetch requests didn't include proper CORS mode and credentials

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes:
1. Updated `config.py` to explicitly list allowed origins:
   ```python
   CORS_ORIGINS: List[str] = ["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:8000"]
   ```

2. Improved the `get_cors_origins()` method to properly parse origins from the environment variable:
   ```python
   def get_cors_origins(self) -> List[str]:
       if self.BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS:
           origins = [origin.strip() for origin in self.BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS.split(",") if origin.strip()]
           return origins if origins else self.CORS_ORIGINS
       return self.CORS_ORIGINS
   ```

3. Enhanced CORS middleware configuration in `main.py`:
   ```python
   app.add_middleware(
       CORSMiddleware,
       allow_origins=cors_origins,
       allow_credentials=True,
       allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS", "PATCH"],
       allow_headers=["*"],
       expose_headers=["Content-Disposition"]
   )
   ```

4. Added debug OPTIONS handler to diagnose CORS preflight requests

### Frontend Changes:
1. Updated API service to include CORS mode and credentials:
   ```typescript
   const response = await fetch(url, {
     headers: {
       'Content-Type': 'application/json',
       ...options?.headers,
     },
     mode: 'cors',
     credentials: 'include',
     ...options,
   });
   ```

2. Added withCredentials to axios client:
   ```typescript
   export const apiClient = axios.create({
     baseURL: API_BASE_URL,
     headers: {
       'Content-Type': 'application/json',
     },
     withCredentials: true,
   });
   ```

## Current Status
The CORS issue should now be resolved. The backend server has been configured to accept requests from the frontend origin, and the frontend is properly sending CORS requests with credentials.

## Verification Steps
1. The backend server logs should show "Configuring CORS with allowed origins: ['http://localhost:3000', 'http://localhost:8000']" on startup
2. When making requests from the frontend, the browser should no longer show CORS errors
3. The properties page should now load data from the API

## Next Steps
If CORS issues persist, check the following:
1. Verify that both servers are running on the expected ports
2. Check browser console for any remaining CORS errors
3. Inspect network requests in browser dev tools to ensure proper headers are being sent/received
4. Verify that the database is properly initialized and contains property data
