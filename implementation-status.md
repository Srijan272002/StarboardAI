# Implementation Status Report

## Completed Tasks

1. **Frontend to Backend API Connection**
   - ✅ Created `.env.local` with API URL configuration
   - ✅ Enhanced API service with proper error handling
   - ✅ Removed mock data from components

2. **Properties Page Fix**
   - ✅ Updated Next.js configuration for proper routing
   - ✅ Added API rewrites to ensure proper API routing
   - ✅ Fixed image domains configuration for property images

3. **Homepage Cleanup**
   - ✅ Removed search properties component from homepage as requested

4. **Backend Updates**
   - ✅ Updated properties endpoint to use real database data instead of mock data
   - ✅ Initialized database with proper schema
   - ✅ Started backend server with hot reload

## Current Status

Both frontend and backend servers are now running:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:8000

The application is now configured to use real data from the database instead of mock data. The properties page should now be accessible and the search functionality on the homepage has been removed as requested.

## Next Steps

1. **Data Population**
   - The database has been initialized but may need to be populated with real property data
   - You can use the API endpoints to add property data or import from CSV/JSON

2. **Testing**
   - Test all API endpoints to ensure they return expected data
   - Verify frontend components display data correctly
   - Test search and filtering functionality

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Consider implementing caching for API responses
   - Add loading states for better user experience

## Potential Issues

1. **Database Connection**
   - If database connection issues occur, verify PostgreSQL is running and credentials in `.env` are correct

2. **CORS Configuration**
   - If API requests fail with CORS errors, verify CORS settings in backend/app/main.py

3. **Image Loading**
   - If property images don't load, verify the image URLs are accessible and the domains are added to next.config.ts
